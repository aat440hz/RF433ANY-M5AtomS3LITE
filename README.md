# RF433ANY-M5AtomS3LITE

RF433ANY-M5AtomS3LITE is designed for the M5AtomS3LITE platform, enabling RF433 signal decoding and analysis. It leverages the RF433any library to provide seamless integration of RF433 communication capabilities into M5Stack ecosystem projects.

## Installation

Download this repository, open the .ino file with Arduino IDE and upload it to your M5AtomS3LITE.

## Features

- Decodes RF433 signals received by an Arduino board connected to a RF433MHz Receiver.
- Supports auto-synchronization protocols including Tri-bit, Tri-bit Inverted, and Manchester.
- Flexible decoding without pre-knowledge about signal timings.
- Outputs timing information in a format ready for use with other RF433 libraries, such as RF433recv.

## Usage

1. Connect your RF433 hardware to the M5AtomS3LITE device and power it on.
2. Upon receiving RF433 signals, the code decodes the signals and outputs timing information to the serial interface.

## Credits

RF433ANY-M5AtomS3LITE is based on the original RF433ANY library by [SÃ©bastien Millet](https://github.com/sebmillet/RF433any), adapted and optimized for the M5Stack ecosystem.
